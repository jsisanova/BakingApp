# Baking App

## Project Overview
Baking App is a part of Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree Program. In this project, we created a responsive app 
that allows users to select a recipe and see the steps how to complete it including video-guided steps.

The recipe listing JSON file is located [here](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/May/59121517_baking/baking.json).

## Concepts that I practised
* Json parsing, AsyncTask
* Using the Adapters and RecyclerViews to populate linear and grid layout
* Responsive Phone and Tablet design (using Fragments)
* Leveraging Android Parcelable interface to transfer object and its data via bundles between fragments
* Exoplayer to display videos for the step instructions
* Implementing [Butterknife](https://jakewharton.github.io/butterknife/), a third-party library used in the app for reducing view injection code
* Handling error cases, using [Espresso](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso) framework to test aspects of the UI  
* Adding a homescreen widget
* Handling screen rotation
* Navigation between individual recipes and recipe steps
